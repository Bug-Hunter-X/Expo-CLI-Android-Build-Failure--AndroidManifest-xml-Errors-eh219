# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: AndroidManifest.xml Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug encountered when building Android apps using the Expo CLI.  The issue stems from problems within the `AndroidManifest.xml` file, often resulting in confusing and unhelpful error messages.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that could lead to this problem (although the exact nature of the error may vary depending on your project configuration). The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates how the problem can be resolved.

## Problem

The root cause usually involves discrepancies between the components declared in your application code and those listed in your `AndroidManifest.xml`. This may occur due to issues with expo's configuration or external libraries. Errors can be triggered during the build process if the manifest is incorrectly formatted or missing necessary components.  The error messages are generally not very informative, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the issue.

## Solution

Carefully review your `AndroidManifest.xml` file and ensure that it is correctly configured to match your application's components. Pay close attention to activities, services, receivers, and providers.  It's also worth checking for any potential syntax errors or inconsistencies within the file. If you are using external libraries, ensure they are correctly integrated and do not conflict with your existing manifest configuration.

This may require verifying library configurations, checking for updates to expo, or consulting the documentation for your libraries or expo.
